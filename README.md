## **Languages, Tools and Libraries:**
**Python, Apache Spark, Django, HTML, CSS, JS, SQLite, Neo4j, 3D Force Graph**

## **Project Preview**

â€¢ Computed **PageRank on the entire Wikipedia dataset** until 01 Dec 2019, and built an **efficient search engine** that produces the top 10 pages for a given keyword, based on pagerank<br>
â€¢ The well-known PageRank algorithm, which is the **Power Iteration of the Matrix Formulation, brings external memory complications** as the number of webpages increases across the World Wide Web<br>
â€¢ The first major outcome of this project is **performing Distributed Processing** on a massive dataset such as the Wikidata dataset that has over 51 million vertices and 141 million edges, by leveraging Apache Spark<br>
â€¢ The second major outcome is the **application of Block Stripe Analysis which combats the memory limitations** posed by the Power Iteration method. It also alleviates and does not specifically need to handle deadends and spider traps.<br>
â€¢ Achieved **100% accuracy** for PageRank values and optimized the computation across 1000 partitions, resulting in a more efficient processing pipeline <br>
â€¢ The application successfully implements a search engine for all Wikipedia articles, with search results ranked by PageRank.<br>
â€¢ Summary of each article implemented using BART algorithm.<br>

## Data Visualization
â€¢ Visualized Wikidata dataset (51 million vertices and 141 million edges) as a **Graph City**

â€¢ The application produces a **subgraph of the relevant search results**, showing how the resulting articles are connected (3D Force Directed Layout)<br>

â€¢ Performed Text summarization on each article using BART technique<br>
â€¢ For each user, the application suggests articles for the user based on previous search history<be>

## **Steps to Run**
1. Download the project directory
2. On the command line, navigate to the project directory -> mds_app
3. Then enter `python manage.py runserver` (make sure python is already installed in your computer)
4. You will see an address like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or with any other port number than 8000
5. Copy and paste that into your browser, the application should now run in your browser
